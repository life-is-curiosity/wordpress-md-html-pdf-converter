Self-Help Guide for the Highly Sensitive
Population－意識上的「高敏感」不但引致很多情緒和身體問題，也會導致很多人際關係問題。The
conscious aspect of “high sensitivity” not only leads to many issues in
the emotion and body but also contributes to various interpersonal
relationship problems.</h1>

很多人忽略自己的意識對外來訊息的高敏感度，不知道自己對環境訊息的過度吸收，而且還會在腦中引發過多的想像，影響人際關係和生活。這是一個在現代社會獨有的問題，除了因為互聯網的普及令大多數人更容易吸收外界的訊息，還有因為自己個人特質上存在的「高敏感（High
Sensitive）」引起很多不必要的情緒、感受、慾望和思考，最後導致很多精神情緒，身體甚至是人際關係問題。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Many people overlook their heightened sensitivity to external stimuli
and remain unaware of their tendency to absorb environmental information
excessively. Moreover, this can lead to an overactive imagination,
impacting interpersonal relationships and daily life. This is a unique
issue in modern society, where the widespread use of the internet has
made it easier for most individuals to absorb external information.
Additionally, personal traits associated with high sensitivity can give
rise to unnecessary emotional experiences, sensations, desires, and
thoughts. Ultimately, these factors can contribute to mental and
emotional problems, and even affect physical well-being and
interpersonal relationships.

高敏感族群有以下特質：<br>The highly sensitive population possesses the
following traits:
</p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
對大腦訊息非常敏感，包括互聯網上、周邊環境、身體的感受如五感刺激很強，對光線、氣味或聲音異常敏感，也會例怕痛、怕熱或怕冷等等。<br>They
are highly sensitive to brain stimuli, including internet information,
the surrounding environment, and bodily sensations such as heightened
sensitivity to the five senses. They may be unusually sensitive to
light, smells, and sounds, and may have specific fears like fear of
pain, heat, or cold.<br>
</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
想像力和同理心很高，輕易對他人的感受作出聯想，情緒反應也會很強烈。<br>They
have a vivid imagination and a high level of empathy. They easily
associate with others’ feelings and their emotional responses tend to be
intense.<br>
</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
觀察、處理和分析外界資訊的程度很高，常常因為反覆思慮而很難在短時間內做出選擇。<br>They
exhibit a high degree of observation, processing, and analyzing external
information. They often engage in repetitive thinking, making it
difficult for them to make choices quickly.<br>
</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
常常會因與他人的關係感到消耗，不常出現在群體活動當中，與伴侶的關係也會比較不和諧。也會容易因為與他人在敏感度上的差異，覺得自己不被理解而感到寂莫。<br>They
frequently feel drained in relationships with others and may not
actively participate in group activities. Their relationships with
partners may also be less harmonious. They may feel a sense of
loneliness due to the perceived lack of understanding from others
regarding their sensitivity differences.<br>
</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
比其他人更容易引發高度緊張、焦慮和恐懼等等情緒問題，也有較高慾望失控的風險。<br>Highly
sensitive individuals are more prone to triggering intense feelings of
nervousness, anxiety, fear, and other emotional problems compared to
others. They also face a higher risk of experiencing uncontrollable
desires.

<p>
「高敏感」是一種天賦，比其他人更容易發展成「雙腦思考」的模式，可以同時兼顧理性和感性思考的平衡。但現代人不像古代人般生活簡單，由於現代社會不斷宣傳各種意識形態和大量資訊，反而讓「高敏感」人士增加太多對身體和大腦不必要的負擔，與他人的關係會容易變得不和諧，也會引起很多未知的皮膚問題，最後惡性循環導致很多更嚴重的情緒問題。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
High sensitivity is an innate gift that makes individuals more prone to
developing a “dual-brain thinking” mode, which allows for a balance
between rational and emotional thinking. However, modern life is not as
simple as it was in ancient times. The continuous promotion of various
ideologies and the abundance of information in modern society have
unintentionally burdened highly sensitive individuals with excessive
strain on their bodies and minds. This, in turn, can lead to disharmony
in relationships with others and give rise to numerous unknown skin
issues. Ultimately, this vicious cycle can lead to even more severe
emotional problems.

「斷食」－可以解決部份因為高敏感而導致的心血管和皮膚（如暗瘡、痤瘡、濕疹等等）<strong>問題</strong>
“Fasting” - Can resolve some cardiovascular and skin (such as acne,
pimples, eczema, etc.) problems caused by high sensitivity.
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
很多心血管、腸胃和皮膚問題從來都是和情緒和慾望問題緊密相連，心血管疾病、腸胃敏感、暗瘡、痤瘡甚至粉瘤，甚至很多皮膚疾病的藥都是和大腦有關。自從本人開始「斷食」後，由開始每日24小時斷食，至到72小時，再到120小時，皮膚會突然變得乾爽，而集中力會變得大幅提高。斷食後不但所有皮膚問題都痊癒，而且還會因為專注力提高對工作和生活都有非常大的益處。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Many skin problems are closely related to emotional and desire issues.
Acne, acne vulgaris, and even lipomas are often linked to the brain.
Since I started “fasting,” from fasting for 24 hours daily to 72 hours
and then to 120 hours, my skin suddenly becomes dry and my concentration
greatly improves. After fasting, not only do all skin problems heal, but
there are also significant benefits for work and life due to increased
focus.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
除了控制體重外，提升代謝率以外，斷食還可以降低血糖和胰島素抗性，以及預防
2
型糖尿病或心臟病等。一些研究結果表明，間歇性禁食可以減少炎症，以及預防慢性疾病。在斷食超過24小時後會在身體觸發自噬反應，細胞自噬是一個重要的生理過程，並在斷食期間得到促進。細胞自噬是身體清除老化、損壞或不需要的細胞成分的過程。當身體處於斷食狀態時，營養供應不足，細胞自噬機制會被啟動。這有助於修復受損的細胞、清除細胞垃圾和促進細胞健康，也會減少三酸甘油脂的分泌而引起的問題如暗瘡、心血管疾病等等。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
In addition to weight control and improved metabolism, fasting can also
lower blood sugar and insulin resistance, as well as prevent type 2
diabetes and heart disease. Some research findings indicate that
intermittent fasting can reduce inflammation and prevent chronic
diseases. After fasting for more than 24 hours, the body triggers
autophagy, which is a vital physiological process that is enhanced
during fasting. Autophagy is the body’s way of clearing out aging,
damaged, or unnecessary cellular components. When the body is in a
fasting state with a limited nutrient supply, the process of cellular
autophagy is activated. This helps repair damaged cells, eliminate
cellular waste, and promote cellular health. It can also reduce the
problems caused by the secretion of triglycerides, such as acne,
cardiovascular diseases, and more.

「不思考」－
可以解決因為高敏感所造成對大腦的過度消耗，和避免因為在人際關係中因為他人而被捲入「情緒漩渦」“Stop
thinking” - can resolve the excessive mental exhaustion caused by high
sensitivity and prevent falling into an “emotional whirlpool” due to
others in interpersonal relationships
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
有「高敏感」自然也會有「低敏感」，「低敏感」人士被環境影響的程度較低，腦中的念頭（聲音）比一般人少，情緒和慾望也會比一般人少，更容易堅定專注在某種事物上，也會較容易放鬆自己。任何環境、大腦和他人的影響都是「高敏感」人士需要面對的課題。我們會因為對外來訊息的極度敏感而潛意識在我們不自覺地接收大量環境訊息，然後又會因為想像力和同理心太過豐富而作出很多多餘的聯想，也過份執著過去的陰影或者對未來過於擔心。當兩個「高敏人」建立一種人際關係，例如情侶和朋友，就會比較容易被對方的情緒所影響，被拖進一個由兩人建立的「情緒漩渦」。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Just as there are “highly sensitive” people, there are also “lowly
sensitive” people. Those who are “lowly sensitive” are less affected by
their environment. They have fewer thoughts (or voices) in their mind
than the average person, and their emotions and desires are also less
than average. They are more likely to focus on something and relax more
easily. Any environmental, brain, and interpersonal influences are
issues that “highly sensitive” people need to face. We subconsciously
receive a large amount of environmental information because of our
extreme sensitivity to external messages, and then we make many
unnecessary associations because of our overly rich imagination and
empathy. We also overly cling to the shadows of the past or worry too
much about the future.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
When two “highly sensitive” people establish a relationship, such as
couples or friends, they are more likely to be affected by each other’s
emotions and get drawn into an “emotional vortex” created by the two.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
所以必須要學會「專心」或「放空」才能減少這些大腦的內在消耗。在一段時間內「專心」在某一樣事物例如跑步、繪畫、書法等等，也可以放大對身邊環境整體的感受身邊環境來「放空」自己。另一個方法是將自己變成作為一個旁觀者去觀察自己，的念頭和情緒，如同一個城市的守門人一樣，有人進城時只需要「知道」這些人的身份後放他們進城即可，不需要每個進城的人都跟隨他們進城，很多人就是因為每個進城的人都要跟縱和調查很久才引起大腦的巨量消耗。你也可以作為一個不負責任的守門人，無論誰進城都好也影響不了你，只需看著這些進城的人或者看著天空發呆放空。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
So, we must learn to “concentrate” or “zone out” to reduce these
internal consumptions of the brain. Focusing on something like running,
drawing, calligraphy, etc. for a period of time can also magnify the
overall feeling of the surrounding environment and “zone out”. Another
method is to turn oneself into an observer to observe one’s own thoughts
and emotions, like a city gatekeeper. When someone enters the city, you
only need to ‘know’ their identity and let them in. You don’t need to
follow every person who enters the city, many people cause a lot of
brain consumption because they have to follow and investigate every
person who enters the city for a long time. You can also be an
irresponsible gatekeeper, no matter who enters the city, it won’t affect
you. You just need to watch these people entering the city or stare at
the sky and zone out.

認知每個人都有他們的痛苦必須要獨自面對 Recognize everyone has their own
pain that they must face alone.
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
無論人有多富有，生活有多優越，都有他們自己的問題要面對。當遇到問題時不妨可以想像其實全世界的人都在獨自面對他們自己的痛苦，在你感到痛苦的當下，其實很多人他們之間雖然素未謀面但是卻在奮勇獨自處理和其他人差不多的問題。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
No matter how wealthy or advantaged one’s life may be, there are their
own problems to confront. When facing problems, it may be comforting to
imagine that everyone in the world is also dealing with their own pain
alone. At the moment you feel pain, many others, although they have
never met you, are also bravely dealing with issues similar to yours.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
每個人經歷當下的痛苦過程會選擇面對、逃避或轉移等等手法應對，不存在一種必須要面對或者必須要逃避的所謂「必然正確」的應對方法。大家都有其選擇的理由和合理性，都是在痛苦中掙札多年的寶貴的經驗。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
People choose different strategies to cope with the pain they are
experiencing at the moment, such as facing it, avoiding it, or diverting
it. There is no so-called “inevitably correct” method that one must
confront or avoid. Everyone has their reasons and rationality for their
choices, all derived from years of struggle in pain.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
“痛苦”是一種在人類社會是一種普遍現象
，每個人都不是特別的一個，而是在一群特別的人中的特別的一個。你遇到的問題肯定會有其他人也在為其掙札苦惱，一定有人曾經走出類似的痛苦或者被類似的痛苦所吞噬。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
“Pain” is a common phenomenon in human society. Everyone is not a unique
one, but a special one among a group of special people. The problems you
encounter are certainly troubling others as well, and there must be
someone who has walked through similar pain or been swallowed by similar
pain.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
了解他者的生活和了解他者的選擇過程有機會可以在他身者身上找到靈感去解決自己的問題。但不要帶著排斥和批判，因為你的批判在你與他者的性格和經歷並不完全絕對相同的情況下是毫無意義而傲慢。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Understanding the lives of others and their decision-making process may
provide inspiration to solve your own problems. But don’t approach this
with rejection or criticism, because your criticism is meaningless and
arrogant under circumstances where your personality and experiences are
not absolutely the same as others.

不需害怕因孤獨造成的寂莫情緒 Do not fear the loneliness caused by
solitude.
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
很多時候人的「愛情」都是想有個他者去陪伴自己去面對生活很多問題，但生活上其實有很多問題需要自己面對，例如自己的情緒、自己的考試、自己的死亡。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Often, people’s “love” is a desire to have someone else accompany them
to face many problems in life, but in fact, there are many problems that
need to be faced by oneself, such as one’s own emotions, one’s own
exams, one’s own death.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
而且就算有個人願意陪伴你，但他並不願意站在你的立場，或者他不了解你的需求和痛苦，你可能也會感受到孤獨。因為不能接受孤獨可能又會隨便找另一個他人，最後又會引發其他更嚴重的問題。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Even if there is someone willing to accompany you, if they are not
willing to stand in your shoes, or they do not understand your needs and
pain, you may still feel lonely. Because you cannot accept loneliness,
you might hastily seek another person, which can lead to other more
serious problems.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
那就不如放鬆接受孤獨是一個人類的普遍現象，接受孤獨所產生的寂莫本身只是一種情緒，情緒並不是一樣可怕的東西。兩個人的不合適和他人所帶來的風險可以比寂莫痛苦百倍。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
It might be better to accept that loneliness is a common phenomenon in
humanity. The loneliness that arises from solitude is just an emotion,
and emotions are not something to be feared. The discomfort of being
mismatched with another person and the risks brought by others can be a
hundred times more painful than loneliness.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
因為情緒會影響我們人生的所有決定，在負面情緒下我們更容易做出錯誤的決定。但當接受和排除寂莫對自己的影響，真正接受孤獨你就不會被這些情緒影響，可以在未來做到一個更合適的決定。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Because emotions affect all decisions in our lives, we are more likely
to make wrong decisions under negative emotions. But when you accept and
eliminate the influence of loneliness on yourself, really accept
loneliness and you will not be affected by these emotions, and you can
make a more appropriate decision in the future.

與自己的情緒相處如同養育一個小孩 Dealing with your own emotions is like
raising a child
</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
與自己的情緒相處如同養育一個小孩，對待小孩不能太過放縱過度滿足他們的慾望，也不能太過嚴厲對他們的生活規範過度苛刻。如果選擇宗教修行或在治療情緒問題，本質上就是與自己的情緒小孩相處，並運用我們的理性將這些感性引導到正確地方。如果選擇世俗生活也必須要對自己的小孩做同樣的教育。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Like raising a child, you cannot indulge them too much or satisfy their
desires excessively, nor can you be too strict about their life norms.
If you choose religious practice or deal with emotional problems,
essentially, you are dealing with your emotional child and using your
rationality to guide these sensibilities to the right place. If you
choose secular life, you must also educate your emotional child in the
same way.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
做人最大的挑戰莫過於此，不但要將「自己的小孩」養育成人，還要讓他們受到正確的教育。現在逃避自己的情緒問題，將來也不能避免要養育自己的小孩的同樣挑戰。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
The greatest challenge in life is none other than this, not only to
raise your “emotional child” to maturity but also to educate them
correctly. If you avoid your emotional problems now, you cannot avoid
the same challenges when raising your own children in the future.
