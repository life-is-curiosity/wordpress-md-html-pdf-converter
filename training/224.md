<p>如果人不斷思考一些自己不能自行驗證的問題，就會陷入過度思考的消耗與疲勞。不斷創造很多幻想去思考一切所有的可能性是一種對腦部非常大的消耗。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>能滿足可以自行驗證這個條件的問題比起大量不能驗證的問題要少很多，也有意義得多 ，並可以透過與他人的交流主觀互證。人只能思考一些可以自行實驗自證的問題才不會陷入因對世界的過度好奇而產生的思考消耗與疲勞。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>要接受有很多問題是未知而且是不能被證實的。</p>

<p>If a person constantly thinks about questions that they cannot independently verify, they will fall into the exhaustion and fatigue of overthinking. Continuously creating many fantasies to consider all possibilities is a very large burden on the brain.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are far fewer questions that can be verified independently than there are unverifiable ones, but they are much more meaningful and can be subjectively corroborated through communication with others. Only by thinking about questions that can be experimentally verified can a person avoid the exhaustion and fatigue that comes from being overly curious about the world.</p>

<p>To accept that there are many questions that are unknown and cannot be proven.</p>
