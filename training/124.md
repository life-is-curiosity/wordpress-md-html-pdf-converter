<p>在金剛經、心經、或者在其他佛教典籍中，常常會見到<strong>法</strong>這個字：</p>

<p>In the Diamond Sutra, Heart Sutra, and other Buddhist scriptures, the word "Dharma" is often seen:</p>

<p>一切有為法，如夢幻泡影，如露亦如電，應作如是觀。</p>

<p><strong>法</strong>&nbsp;(Dharma)，音譯達摩，是指該事物所包含的一切屬性和特質。如冰之法包含冷與硬，火之法包含光與熱，佛法所謂的法為人的心之法，比如所有的感受、情緒、慾望、貪愛、嗔恨等等。心經所指的「諸法空相」是指人心中生起的一切都是空的，虛幻不實的。很多人會受到這些人心自帶的屬性影響，而認為它們是真實的。原始佛法認為我們必須看透這些法的虛幻，從而不再認可它們，最後獲得解脫。</p>

<p>"Dharma" refers to all the attributes and qualities contained in a thing. For example, the "Dharma" of ice includes coldness and hardness, while the "Dharma" of fire includes light and heat. In Buddhist teachings, the "Dharma" refers to the mind of a person, including all feelings, emotions, desires, attachments, and aversions. The "All phenomena are empty" in the Heart Sutra refers to the fact that everything that arises in the mind is empty and illusory. Many people are affected by the inherent attributes of their minds and believe that they are real. Original Buddhism believes that we must see through the illusory nature of these "Dharma" and no longer recognize them, eventually achieving liberation.</p>

<p>這句說話原意是，所有人心的屬性都是虛幻的，如夢幻泡影一般生滅無常。它們可如露一樣緩慢集結也不自知，也可如雷電一樣雖快速出現並消逝，卻產生強大沖擊。我們看待它應該像他人觀看自己一樣，不要被它影響。</p>

<p>The original meaning of this statement is that the attributes of everyone's heart are illusory, like a fleeting dream or bubble. They can slowly gather like dew without being aware, or quickly appear and disappear like thunder and lightning, but have a strong impact. We should view them as others observe us, and not be influenced by them.</p>
