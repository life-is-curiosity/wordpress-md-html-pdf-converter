# 常見佛教修行 Q&amp;A Common Q&amp;A on Buddhist Meditation Practice

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">佛陀所指的開悟究竟是什麼？ What exactly did the Buddha mean by enlightenment?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>開悟是指透過冥想來解脫一切潛意識對顯意識的束縛，包括本能、情緒和慾望等等後， 最後達到對自己意識有極致的覺知和平等的境界。因腦中分泌大量DMT後進入一種特殊意識狀態， 當中包括「瀕死」、「極度清靜」和潛意識影響逐漸消失等等的意識行為特徵，名為「涅槃」。超越涅槃後可證名為「阿羅漢果」的境界，而佛陀也是這個境界。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enlightenment refers to the liberation from all subconscious bindings on conscious awareness through meditation, including instincts, emotions, desires, and so on, and ultimately attaining the utmost awareness and an equal state of mind. Due to the secretion of a large amount of DMT in the brain, a special state of consciousness is reached, which includes behavioral characteristics such as "near-death", "extreme tranquility", and gradually disappearing influence from the subconscious, called "nirvana". Beyond nirvana is a state called "arhat", which is proven by surpassing nirvana, and the Buddha also achieved this state.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">禪修是思想或邏輯上的活動，還是身體或意識層面的活動？ Is meditation a mental or logical activity, or a physical or conscious activity?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>意識層面的活動。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Conscious activity</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><a href="https://curiosityforever.wordpress.com/2023/02/21/%e6%ad%a3%e7%a2%ba%e5%8e%9f%e5%a7%8b%e4%bd%9b%e6%b3%95%e4%bf%ae%e8%a1%8c%e7%9b%ae%e7%9a%84%e8%88%87%e6%96%b9%e5%90%91%e9%98%bf%e8%80%a8%e5%a4%9a%e7%be%85%e4%b8%89%e8%97%90%e4%b8%89%e8%8f%a9%e6%8f%90/">正確原始佛法修行目的與方向－「阿耨多羅三藐三菩提」亦即是「無上正等正覺」The correct purpose and direction of original Buddhist practice is to attain “Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi”, which is also known as “supreme perfect enlightenment and&nbsp;equality”</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">比如我邏輯上可以接受或相信，我們所看到的世界都是幻想，世界的真相也許就是類似《Matrix》的世界。但我沒有身體上的感受，也沒有看到或感受到那個我認為的真實世界，這樣算不算開悟？ For example, I can logically accept or believe that the world we see is all an illusion and that the truth of the world may be similar to the world in The Matrix. But I don't have the physical sensation, nor have I seen or felt the reality that I think exists. Would this count as enlightenment?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>不算，不僅是邏輯上的理解，還要有感性的體會。對世界一切事物是虛幻的理解和體會是為了幫助解決一些在冥想禪修當中遇到的問題，例如以對世界事物空性的思考和體會來放下對物質和人際關係的執著等等。一切的道理和思想工具都只是單純地為了幫助冥想禪修。而開悟只能透過禪修冥想來實現。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only is it a matter of logical understanding, but also requires a sense of intuition. Understanding and experiencing that all things in the world are illusory is to help solve some of the problems encountered during meditation. For example, using the contemplation and understanding of the emptiness of worldly things to let go of attachment to material possessions and interpersonal relationships. All principles and tools of thought are solely for the purpose of assisting in meditation. Enlightenment can only be achieved through meditation.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">冥想（打坐）是否能開悟？  Can meditation lead to enlightenment?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>可以。《道德經》和《太平經》所指的守一、莊子的坐忘、佛教的「觀自在」、「止觀」與「定慧」等等都是「冥想」，並提出透過冥想來解脫潛意識對顯意識的依附和影響。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainly. The "Oneness" referred to in the&nbsp;Tao Te Ching&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Tai Ping&nbsp;Jing, the "Zuo Wang" of Zhuangzi, and the "Samadhi," "Vipassana," and "Samatha-Vipassana" of&nbsp;Buddhism, all refer to "meditation," and suggest that through meditation, one can liberate oneself from the attachment and influence of the subconscious on the conscious mind.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">冥想（打坐）的目的是什麼？ What is the purpose of meditation?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>讓顯意識獲得所有控制權，讓潛意識裡的「垃圾（情緒、慾望、過去的陰影和本能）」因被顯意識的「覺照和平等對待」而被清空的狀態。最後超越潛意識的最後抵抗造成的瀕死（被稱為「涅槃」，在古吠陀修行文化被認為是一種死亡的考驗）後成為覺悟者（阿羅漢 ）。狀態類似《清靜經》中所指的「極致的靜」。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It refers to a state where the conscious mind gains full control, and the subconscious is cleared of all its "garbage" (emotions, desires, past traumas, and instincts) due to the "illumination and equal treatment" of the conscious mind. Finally, transcending the last resistance of the subconscious, which can cause a near-death experience (known as "nirvana" and is considered a test of death in ancient Vedic culture), one becomes an enlightened person (an arhat). This state is similar to the ultimate stillness described in the "Sutra of Complete Enlightenment".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">神通是否存在？ Does supernatural power exist?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>神通只存在於意識層面，在對肉體的脫離的狀態下才會顯現。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Supernatural power only exists in the realm of consciousness and will only manifest when one is detached from the physical body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">神通更類似於禪定中的幻覺？ Is supernatural power more like an illusion in meditation?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>是副作用。在禪修當中出現的種種異像只是一些多餘的大腦訊息，更甚會令人因為異像而自我滿足後造成境界停滯。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a side effect. The various illusions that appear during meditation are only some unnecessary signals in the brain, which may cause one to become stagnant in their practice due to self-satisfaction from illusion.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">神通是自己大腦偽造出來的嗎？ Is supernatural power something that the brain creates?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>視乎當時人的情況。有可能是幻覺，但你無從分辨，既然無法分辨就捨棄這些似幻似真的感覺。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It depends on the situation of the individual. It could be an illusion, but since it is impossible to distinguish, it is best to abandon these seemingly illusory feelings.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">透過冥想（打坐）實現開悟的唯一條件是「抛棄掉所有感官與思維的干擾」？ Is the only condition for achieving enlightenment by meditation is "abandon all interference from the senses and thoughts"?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>沒錯，在純意識層面抛棄掉所有感官與思維的干擾。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, it is to completely abandon all interference from the senses and thoughts in a purely conscious realm.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">冥想（打坐）初學者常常感受到自己被自己的思維束縛，並未進入潛意識世界，甚至感受不到潛意識的存在，該如何理解潛意識對顯意識的束縛？Beginner meditators often feel that their thoughts are holding them back from entering the subconscious world, and may not even sense the presence of their subconscious. How should we understand the subconscious's hold on the&nbsp;conscious mind?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>其實這是典型對自己意識運作缺乏深刻認識而形成的誤解和錯誤判斷。被思維「束縛」其實和顯意識（理性）無關，「束縛」其實是一種「力」去驅動和影響顯意識去思考。例如你的潛意識不斷給你念頭，你又不斷投入念想去思考，然後又排洩出一些情緒和慾望（自我感覺良好，好奇慾，對未知的執著等等）。這些情緒和慾望又反過來鼓勵你不斷投入思考，這種情況就等於你的顯意識被潛意識在背後驅動和控制，潛意識在背後偽裝成顯意識的行為，讓人感覺不到潛意識的存在，因為潛意識最怕是被「覺知」。要理解潛意識和顯意識之間的關係和運作，必須要先抽離後以第三身角度觀察內在意識運作，盡可能先分離潛意識對顯意識依附，再分別進行觀察和體會。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, this is a misunderstanding and a misjudgment that arises from a lack of profound understanding of one's own consciousness. Being "held back" by thoughts is actually not related to the conscious mind (reason), but rather a "force" that drives and influences the conscious mind to think. For example, if your subconscious keeps giving you thoughts, and you keep investing in thinking about them, and then releasing some emotions and desires (feeling good, curiosity, attachment to the unknown, etc.), these emotions and desires will encourage you to keep thinking. This situation is equivalent to your conscious mind being driven and controlled by the&nbsp;subconscious mind&nbsp;behind the scenes. The subconscious mind disguises itself as the behavior of the conscious mind, making it difficult to sense its presence, because the subconscious mind is most afraid of being "aware". To understand the relationship and operation between the subconscious and conscious mind, one must first detach and observe the&nbsp;inner consciousness&nbsp;from a third-person perspective, try to separate the attachment of the subconscious to the conscious mind, and then observe them separately to gain insight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">冥想打座會否「走火入魔」？ Will meditating lead to "possession by spirits" (or being "crazy")?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>坊間流傳有很多種冥想方法， 不論古時流傳在各種宗教經典當中的方法， 例如原始道教中的「守一」、莊子的「坐忘」、佛教的「定慧」（或稱「止觀」）、《清靜經》的內觀方法和《太乙金華宗旨》提及的「回光之法」等等，現代在互聯網上也有很多各式各樣的自我催眠或者冥想方法，例如「阿卡西紀錄」冥想法、薩滿心靈動物冥想法、氣功觀身冥想法、神像觀修法、「地獄旅遊」等等新興的冥想甚至「通靈」方法，例如基督靈恩教派的「聖靈擊倒與方言」、巫術宗教文化的「僮身法」等等。 <strong>的確， 有部份人沒有了解過自己的意識運作之前就嘗試各式各樣的冥想方法最後導致出現一些嚴重的精神問題，甚至出現被認為是「鬼附」的現象求助各類型宗教的法師為其作出驅鬼行為， 甚至因此流傳冥想打座前需要設定「結界」或進行一些宗教儀式如曬聖水、在一個受神保護的地方進行冥想等等，不然就如打開身體的「門」後被鬼所附體。導致這些意識上的問題其根本原因是「錯誤的冥想方法和動機」。</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many types of meditation methods that have been passed down through various religious scriptures throughout history, such as the "guarding the one" method in original Taoism, the "sitting and forgetting" method in Zhuangzi, the "samadhi and prajna" (or "stopping and seeing") method in Buddhism, the introspective method in the "Qingjing Jing," and the "method of returning light" mentioned in the "Taiyi Jinhua Zongzhi," etc. Nowadays, there are also many different self-hypnosis or meditation methods available on the internet, such as the "Akashic Records" meditation method, the shamanic animal spirit meditation method, the qigong visualization meditation method, the statue contemplation method, the "hell travel" meditation, and even "mediumship" methods e.g. the "falling of the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues" in the Pentecostal denomination, and the "possession ceremony" in witchcraft religious culture, and so on. However, some people who have not understood how their consciousness works have tried various meditation methods without proper guidance, resulting in serious mental problems and even phenomena believed to be "possession by spirits," leading them to seek help from various religious masters to perform exorcism rituals. Therefore, it is said that one needs to set up a "boundary" or perform some religious rituals such as sunning holy water or meditating in a place protected by gods before meditating, otherwise, one may be possessed by spirits like opening the door to one's body. The root cause of these conscious problems is "wrong meditation methods and motivations."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>根據本人了解，很多所謂「錯誤的冥想」行為導致精神失常的情況大概有以下幾點：<br>Based on my understanding, there are several factors that can lead to mental disorders caused by so-called "wrong meditation" practices:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>帶著過度的情緒慾望和一些不切實際的期待和執著進行冥想行為。例如為了看見死去的親人、為了到地獄旅行、為了開自己的「第三眼」、為了知道自己的所謂「心靈動物」等等奇怪的目的進行冥想打座行為。<strong>帶著大量的情緒慾望和執著去冥想打座是非常危險的行為。</strong><br>Engaging in meditation with excessive emotional desires and unrealistic expectations and attachments, such as meditating to see deceased relatives, travel to hell, open one's "third eye," or know one's so-called "spirit animal." Meditating with a lot of emotional desires and attachments is a very dangerous behaviour.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>過度投入到自己潛意識的幻象。即使身體出現一點點「異常（副作用）」也會對其異常執著；也會有人看到很多潛意識所提供的「畫面」， 並主動地投入和窮追一些在冥想期間潛意識製造的虛幻的處境當中， 不能自拔。<br>Overly indulging in illusions of one's subconscious mind. Even if the body experiences a little "abnormality (side effect)," some people will be extremely attached to it. Some may see a lot of "images" provided by their subconsciousness and actively immerse themselves in and pursue some illusory situations created by their subconsciousness during meditation, unable to extricate themselves.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>在冥想打座期間一遇到任何問題馬上主動放棄顯意識的控制，完全交出自己意識的所有控制權給潛意識，導致潛意識當中儲存的「垃圾」大量湧現，例如童年陰影、情緒慾望等等。<strong>在冥想期間完全放棄顯意識對潛意識的覺知和平等心，甘願被潛意識吞噬是對自己非常不負責任和消極的行為，這也是大多數人冥想後出現精神異常的主要原因。 </strong><br>Giving up conscious control at the slightest problem during the meditation period and completely surrendering all control of one's consciousness to the subconsciousness, leads to a large amount of "garbage" stored in the subconsciousness emerging, such as childhood shadows, emotional desires, etc. Completely giving up the awareness and equanimity of the conscious mind towards the subconsciousness and willingly being swallowed up by the subconsciousness is very irresponsible and passive behaviour oneself, and it is also the main reason why most people experience mental abnormalities after meditation.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>冥想打座是「禪修」的其中一種方法，「禪修」的本質是平等心與覺知力的顯意識訓練，擺脫潛意識對顯意識的依附。禪修就像在大海行駛上的船一樣，思緒、情緒和慾望等等就像海上的各種情況，有風平浪靜的時候，也有狂風暴雨的時候。訓練自己面對狂風暴雨的平等心和覺知在大海航行每一刻的變化，不要翻船沉入大海，這就是禪修。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meditation is a practice that trains the conscious with equanimity and mindfulness, to get rid of subconscious attachment to conscious. It is like sailing on the ocean, where thoughts, emotions, and desires are like various conditions on the sea. Sometimes there are&nbsp;calm winds&nbsp;and smooth sailing, while other times there are storms and rough waters. Through this practice, we train ourselves to face the changing conditions of the sea with equanimity and mindfulness, so that we do not capsize and sink into the ocean. This is&nbsp;meditation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>正確的禪修狀態必然是顯意識活躍，人會進入異常清醒明朗和極度專注的狀態，潛意識在這期間的控制權會被大大削弱，所以是完全沒有理由需要擔心任何外來或內在的原因導致因冥想而突然精神失常 。</strong> 開始冥想之前不要對冥想有太大期望，想從冥想得到某種神通和智慧，或者期望冥想一定能帶給你平靜喜悅，這會對冥想產生執著。冥想也是有無常起伏，可能進行冥想幾個月也體會不到明顯個人變化，但不要太執著階段性的結果及過去的冥想經驗，每日堅持一步步來，靜看花開，在冥想當中體驗當下每一刻。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The correct state of meditation necessarily involves active consciousness. People will enter a state of abnormal clarity and extreme focus, and the control of the subconscious will be greatly weakened during this period. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to worry about any external or internal factors causing sudden mental illness due to meditation. Before starting meditation, do not have high expectations for it, such as wanting to gain supernatural powers and wisdom, or expecting meditation to bring you peace and joy. This will lead to attachment in your practice. Meditation has ups and downs; you may not notice significant personal changes even after months of practice. Don’t be too attached to the results or past meditation experiences. Persist in taking it one step at a time, quietly observing the blossoming of flowers and experiencing every moment in your practice.</p>
