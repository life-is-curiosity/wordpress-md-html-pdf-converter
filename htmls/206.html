佛法常常被從不同的角度誤解，在一般大學哲學系會被大學教授們單純地解讀成一套「處世哲學」或「空性哲學」，以事物的「無常」去解釋事物的屬性為「空」。在社會平民大眾會被解讀成一煲提倡「賞善罰惡的心靈雞湯」，做好事會有好報，做壞事會有報應，做好事輪迴後會投胎去有錢人家，做壞事下輩子會傷殘。在一般大乘佛法系統內卻不斷宣傳一個名為「極樂世界」的彼岸，鼓勵放生與佈施等等。在東南亞等地的「上座部佛教」亦包含一套「巫術」系統，施法幫人招財招姻緣，甚至可以「詛咒」他人等等。

Buddhism is often misunderstood from different perspectives. In general
philosophy departments of universities, it is simply interpreted as a
“philosophy of life” or “philosophy of emptiness,” explaining the
attribute of things as “empty” based on their impermanence. Among the
general public, it is often interpreted as promoting a “spiritual
chicken soup” that advocates “rewarding good and punishing evil.” Doing
good will bring good karma, while doing bad will result in retribution.
Doing good will allow one to be reborn in a wealthy family in the next
life, while doing bad will result in disability in the next life. In the
Mahayana Buddhist system, there is constant promotion of a paradise
called the “Pure Land,” which encourages practices such as releasing
captive animals and giving donations. In Southeast Asian countries, the
Theravada Buddhism also includes a system of “witchcraft,” which can be
used to help people attract wealth and find love or even curse others.

對佛法產生大量誤解的原因為「權威」，例如坊間比較知名的有星雲大師、妙蓮老和尚等等，很多大學教授因為「學術權威」的影響，課堂內容也是依據這些大師的「道理」，再搬到大學哲學系作為一門課程，並沒有真正對佛法有多少了解。而且很多大師也是不斷用一些似是而非而又深奧的佛教名詞去解釋很多佛教概念，而當中很多解釋都是<strong><span
style="text-decoration:underline">誤解</span></strong>。因為佛法有一個非常非常重要的原則是很多所謂大師與教授所忽略，就是<strong><span
style="text-decoration:underline">佛法不是用於解釋包含於物理世界內、社會人際關係間等等客觀現象，而是解釋作用於人心內的各種主觀感受和提供一些針對意識的行為（冥想、禪修、正念專注在當下等等）去除情緒、慾望等等潛意識所帶來的心理依賴和負擔</span></strong>。這是正確理解佛法的基本原則。

The main reason for the widespread misunderstanding of Buddhism is due
to “authority,” such as well-known figures like Master Hsing Yun and
Venerable Miaolian. Many university professors teach based on the
“teachings” of these masters, influenced by their “academic authority,”
without truly understanding Buddhism. Furthermore, many masters
continuously use vague or profound Buddhist terms to explain many
Buddhist concepts, many of which are misunderstandings.<strong> This is
because Buddhism has a very, very important principle that many
so-called masters and professors overlook, which is that Buddhism is not
used to explain objective phenomena in the physical world or social
relationships, but rather to explain various subjective feelings within
the human mind and provide some behavior aimed at consciousness (such as
meditation, mindfulness, and focus on the present moment) to eliminate
psychological dependency and burdens caused by emotions, desires, and
subconsciousness. This is the basic principle of correctly understanding
Buddhism.</strong>

什麼叫做「緣起」？緣起就是說很多條件來呈現、完成一件事情；什麼叫「性空」？就是說一切事物既然都是條件的組合，那麼它們就不會有自己的本性、自己的個性，沒有不變性、永恆性、和自主性，就是這樣而已。當有人說起「緣起性空」常常會遇到一個問題，就是「就算我知道所有事物都是緣起性空，無獨立自性又如何？」

What is “dependent origination”? Dependent origination means that many
conditions come together to present and complete something. What is
“emptiness”? It means that since all things are a combination of
conditions, they do not have their own nature, personality, permanence,
or autonomy. That’s all there is to it. When someone talks about
“dependent origination and emptiness,” they often encounter a problem,
which is “even if I know that all things are dependent origination and
emptiness without independent self-nature, what difference does it
make?”

佛法有所謂「十二因緣（或稱十二緣起）」，
包括此十二緣起分別是：無明、行、識、名色、六入、觸、受、愛、取、有、生、老死。十二緣起當中所有「緣起」
都是人心內升起的主觀感受。所謂「緣」，
其實是依附的意思。我們在經歷我們的人生期間，潛意識內會積存很多「垃圾」，
例如童年陰影、過去不好的回憶等等。
當在某刻接收到某種訊息後，會刺激到你的潛意識依附於你的顯意識，從而產生情緒感覺、慾望甚至幻象，令你信以為真。一切的情緒和慾望都是:

In Buddhism, there is a concept called the ‘Twelve Nidanas’ (or Twelve
Links of Dependent Origination), which include ignorance, volitional
activities, consciousness, name and form, the six sense bases, contact,
feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, and aging and death. All of
these ‘links’ are subjective feelings that arise in the human mind. The
term ‘nidana’ actually means attachment. During our lifetime, we
accumulate a lot of ‘junk’ in our subconscious, such as childhood trauma
and unpleasant memories. When we receive certain messages at a certain
moment, it will stimulate our subconscious to attach to our conscious
mind, thereby producing emotional feelings, desires, and even illusions,
making us believe them to be true. All emotions and desires are:

<strong>緣起從來和事物本身的性質是否為「空性」無關</strong>，<strong>用來解釋因事物隨時間而變化呈現的所謂「無常感」是一種非常嚴重的誤解</strong>。當了解這些

<strong>Dependent origination has nothing to do with whether the nature
of things themselves is ‘emptiness’, and using it to explain the
so-called ‘impermanent feeling’ that arises as things change over time
is a serious misunderstanding.</strong> When we understand how these

way, and then realize that they are just illusions created by our minds.
We can then be vigilant and avoid being influenced by these feelings.

佛教的因果觀，源自「緣起性空」的道理，宇宙間萬事萬物，都是仗因託「緣」，才有果的生起，而此果又成為因，待緣聚又生他果，如是展轉相攝，乃成森羅萬象。所以，大至一個世界，小如一個微塵，都沒有實存的自性可言，而因緣不同，果報就會有所差異。所以，因果的道理，豎窮三際，橫遍十方；因果的相狀，有如蛛網，錯綜複雜。因果的觀念則認為：所有的果報，不管善惡，都是自己造作出來的。譬如有人一出生就住在繁華的都市裡，享受文明的生活，有人終其一生，都在荒山野地、窮鄉僻壤營生，日月窮勞，這不是命運不公平，而是因緣果報不同。無論是行善或為惡，都會得到相對的回應，稱爲「報應」；而在後世解釋「報應」多為「行惡後的果報」。

The Buddhist view of cause and effect is not just about “karmic
consequences,” but also includes the concept of “karmic force.” “Karmic
force” refers to the accumulation of one’s past actions, thoughts, and
emotions, which will affect one’s future experiences and influence one’s
present state of mind. Therefore, the Buddhist view of cause and effect
emphasizes the importance of cultivating good karma and purifying
negative karma, not only for the sake of future karmic consequences but
also for the present state of mind and well-being. Furthermore, the
Buddhist view of cause and effect is not deterministic, meaning that
one’s actions and intentions in the present can influence future karmic
consequences, and one can change the course of one’s future by making
positive changes in one’s thoughts, speech, and actions. Therefore, the
Buddhist view of cause and effect is not fatalistic, but rather
empowering, as it provides a path for one to take responsibility for
one’s own actions and create a positive future.

從上例可知其實「緣」從來不是對世間萬事萬物的現象作出歸納性的解釋，所以「因果」與「業力」也是常常被不同文化背景人士加以演釋成一種基本邏輯關係並套用在所有世界法則之中，例如一個人行惡後會有報應，或者造了「孽」牽連家人或者下一代，更甚會被鬼纏身，下輩子會傷殘或者早夭等等。據我觀察所得，幾乎所有人對「因果」與「業力」的理解都是強行以這種華人宗教觀去曲解「因果」與「業力」真實的含意。其實這是出自原始佛教對意識學概念，和你的善行與惡行無關。因為在當時的修行文化和語境下，
所謂<strong>「惡行」其實是指「所有讓人遠離清靜的行為」</strong>。<strong>「善行」其實是指「所有讓人走向清靜的行為」</strong>。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
From the previous example, it can be seen that “dependence” has never
been a generalized explanation for all phenomena in the world.
Therefore, “cause and effect” and “karmic force” are often interpreted
by people from different cultural backgrounds as a basic logical
relationship and applied to all laws of the world. For example, it is
believed that a person will receive karmic consequences after doing
evil, or that one’s family or descendants will be affected by one’s bad
karma, and one might even be haunted by ghosts, become disabled, or die
young in the next life. Based on my observations, almost everyone’s
understanding of “cause and effect” and “karmic force” is a forced
interpretation of the true meaning of these concepts through the lens of
Chinese religious beliefs. In fact, these concepts come from the
original Buddhist concept of consciousness, and have nothing to do with
your good or bad deeds. In the cultural and contextual context of that
time, <strong>the so-called “evil deeds” actually referred to “all
actions that lead people away from peace and tranquility,” while “good
deeds” referred to “all actions that lead people towards peace and
tranquility.”</strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

所以<strong>「因果」是指每個人因外部環境訊息而造成內在心中的變化。比如過去童年有一些創傷經歷，導致成年後的行為偏差，或者過去受過的辱罵屈辱，成為未來的執著。這些經歷都會因為在未來某一刻的訊息接收而觸發，甚至很多情緒反應大到會破壞客觀理性認知，否定事實。內心根據外部環境變化而變化，不受控制。</strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Therefore,<strong> “cause and effect” refers to the internal changes in
a person’s mind caused by external environmental information. For
example, childhood traumatic experiences can lead to behavioral
deviations in adulthood, or past insults and humiliations can become
future obsessions. These experiences can be triggered by information
received at a certain moment in the future, and even emotional reactions
can be so strong that they can destroy objective rational cognition and
deny facts. The internal changes in the mind are based on external
environmental changes and are uncontrollable.</strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>
人類的認知是有缺憾和局限的，就是只能基於自己的理解範圍去理解別人的說法，當表達者說出超出理解者的認知時，理解者就會根據自己的理解和認知去曲解別人的意思，所以佛教中的「因果」被曲解的原因為強行使用外部構成的認知去理解佛法。<strong>我們需要斬斷的並不是因也不是果，而是「業力」。「業力」就是「因果」中的連接，例如你對蟑螂有恐懼之心，如果<strong>「業力」</strong>強就代表恐懼之心有多大，
有些人甚至會影響生理例如昏厥和暈眩，我們的本我都是被「業力」捆綁，而禪修就是斬斷「業力」的手段</strong>。但並不是所有的「業力」都是需要被清除的，例如有所謂「善業」去連結個體「因果」會讓心理狀態更健康。

Human cognition is imperfect and limited, and we can only understand
others’ statements based on our own understanding. When the speaker
expresses something beyond the listener’s comprehension, the listener
will interpret the speaker’s meaning based on their own understanding
and cognition. Therefore, the reason why “cause and effect” in Buddhism
is distorted is that external cognitive structures are used to
understand Buddhism. <strong>What we need to break is not the cause or
the effect, but the “karmic force.” “Karmic force” is the connection in
“cause and effect.” For example, if you have a fear of cockroaches, if
the “karmic force” is strong, it means that the fear is strong, and some
people may even experience physical symptoms such as fainting and
dizziness. Our ego is bound by “karmic force,”</strong> and meditation
is a means of breaking it. However, not all “karmic forces” need to be
eliminated. For example, there are so-called “good karmic forces” that
link individual “cause and effect” and can make one’s mental state
healthier.

佛教認為，世間一切都是因緣所生，人與人的關係同樣如此。所謂「善緣」，通常來說，是指那些對我們的生活、學習、工作有正面幫助的關係，可能發生在父母與兒女之間，也可能存在於師生、夫妻、朋友、同事之間，雙方能夠互相關愛，和諧共處。而從佛法角度來看，真正的善緣還不僅於此，更是指那些令生命品質得以提升的緣，比如聽聞佛法的緣，依止善知識的緣。既然有善緣，自然會有與之相對的「惡緣」，這是一種直接給我們帶來痛苦的因素。可能是家庭中親人的折磨，也可能是工作中同事的排擠，等等。

Buddhism believes that everything in the world arises from causes and
conditions, and human relationships are no exception. The so-called
“good karma” usually refers to those relationships that have positive
effects on our lives, learning, and work. These relationships can occur
between parents and children, as well as between teachers and students,
spouses, friends, and colleagues, where both parties can love each other
and live in harmony. From the perspective of Buddhism, true good karma
goes beyond this and refers to those relationships that can elevate the
quality of life, such as the karma of hearing the Dharma and depending
on good spiritual friends. Since there is good karma, there will
naturally be “bad karma” that directly causes us suffering. This may be
the torment of family members in the home, or the exclusion of
colleagues in the workplace, and so on.

Buddhism is not intended to explain and deal with social relationships
between people. The most important aspect of Buddhist practice has
always been meditation, which involves observing and experiencing
various illusory emotions arising from our subconsciousness through
introspection, training our awareness and equanimity, and attaining
“self-awareness.” It is an absolute personal behavior. Therefore, the
highest level in Buddhism is the attainment of “Supreme Enlightenment”
(Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi), which enables one to be aware of changes in
one’s emotions, manifest consciousness, and subconsciousness at any
time. After becoming aware, one can detach oneself from these external
information and subconscious influences and observe them from a
third-person perspective, regardless of how uncomfortable or terrifying
the feeling, how hateful the memory, how real the illusion, or how
pleasant the mood. This is called “Right Awareness” (Samma-sati) and
“Right Equanimity” (Samma-upekkha). “Supreme” refers to the state of
practicing Right Awareness and Right Equanimity to the ultimate level.

As for some Theravada Buddhism traditions in Southeast Asia that use

practices were essentially influenced by the mixture of Buddhism and

rituals into Buddhism and claim that they can use magic to help people
have good relationships, wealth, romance, and avoid harm from enemies.
These witchcraft practices are not advocated by Buddhism and can even
lead people to become more attached to the material world and lose
themselves.

“Dharma” refers to all the attributes and qualities contained in a
thing. For example, the “Dharma” of ice includes coldness and hardness,
while the “Dharma” of fire includes light and heat. In Buddhist
teachings, the “Dharma” refers to the mind of a person, including all
feelings, emotions, desires, attachments, and aversions. The “All
phenomena are empty” in the Heart Sutra refers to the fact that
everything that arises in the mind is empty and illusory. Many people
are affected by the inherent attributes of their minds and believe that
they are real. Original Buddhism believes that we must see through the
illusory nature of these “Dharma” and no longer recognize them,
eventually achieving liberation.

बोध（bodhi），意譯為覺，覺知，覺性。顯意識主動去感知而不要接受潛意識升起的想法。時時感受自己的狀態，控制好自己的注意力在當下。在日常生活中，在走的時候知道在走，站著、坐著、臥著、吃飯時，當下要知道身體的動作，妄念生起時立刻以覺性知道，如此在生活中把覺性貫穿起來。和單純的專注(Concentration)不一樣，雖然專注和覺知都會要求不捲入妄念，但一種是專注一點，忘記旁邊；另一種是心是開放的，看到或聽到的東西不去分析探究，只是放鬆(但也不能懶散，要維持中道)地接受當下發生的所有事情，而心不捲入妄念中。但專注會帶來壓力和緊張，忽略周圍情況專注在一點。但覺知(Awareness)沒有壓力，放鬆覺知周遭的情況，接受干擾的出現、經過、消失，心只覺知而不受其產生的妄念干擾。不排斥妄念，知道妄念生起並立刻滅去，不壓制念頭，也不隨念頭跑。

Bodhi, Sanskrit for बोध (bodhi), means awakening, awareness, and
consciousness. It means actively perceiving with consciousness rather
than accepting thoughts that arise from the subconscious. We should
constantly feel our own state and control our attention in the present
moment. In daily life, we should be aware of our actions when walking,
standing, sitting, lying down, or eating. When delusions arise, we
should immediately know it with our awareness. By doing so, we can
integrate awareness into our daily life.

Bodhi is different from simple concentration. Although both require us
to avoid getting involved in delusions, concentration is about focusing
on one point and ignoring what is happening around it. On the other
hand, awareness means keeping an open mind and accepting everything that
happens in the present moment without analyzing or exploring it, while
not getting caught up in delusions. Concentration can bring stress and
tension, and it may ignore the surrounding situation. But awareness does
not have pressure. It relaxes and is aware of the surrounding situation,
accepting the appearance, passing, and disappearance of interference,
and the mind only knows but is not disturbed by the delusions they
generate. We should not reject delusions, but we should know when they
arise and immediately extinguish them, without suppressing or following
them.

“Bodhisattva” is a compassionate Buddhist deity. The Mahayana Buddhism
proposes a system of ten Bodhisattva levels, which are above the “four
stages of enlightenment” in early Buddhism. Bodhisattva is a level in
the system, representing a particular spiritual realm and level of
practice.

「菩薩」全寫為「菩提薩埵」（梵語：बोधिसत्त्व，bodhi—sattva；巴利語：बोधिसत्त，bodhisatta）意譯為覺有情渡眾生（有情眾生是指一切有心智的生物），在原始佛法並不是一個果位或神靈。「菩薩乘」為一種義務工作的修行，
負責傳播原始佛法思想者的稱號，推廣冥想行為和教導有關意識的知識。只要正確地宣揚正確的佛法任何人都可以成為「菩薩」。

“Bodhisattva” (Sanskrit: बोधिसत्त्व, bodhi-sattva; Pali: बोधिसत्त,
bodhisatta), which is translated as “enlightenment (promote meditation
and tech the knowledge of consciousness) for the benefit of all sentient
beings” (sentient beings refer to all living beings with consciousness).
In early Buddhism, it was not a stage of attainment or “god” or “holy
spirit”. “Bodhisattva vehicle” is a type of practice that involves
voluntary work and is the title given to those who propagate the ideas
of early Buddhism. Anyone who spreads the correct teachings of Buddhism
correctly can become a “Bodhisattva”.

「相」其實出自佛教用語，所謂的「相」是指所有一切你認為客觀存在的事物都是由「法
(人心的屬性)」所呈現，
「相」代表因過去經歷和已形成的性格造成主觀意識對外界事物的倒影和判斷，和事物的外在沒有任何關係。我們人體有很多感官可以令我們透過視覺、聽覺、觸覺、味覺、嗅覺等去感知一種事物不同的面向，在原始佛教中認為，一切經由我們在意識下的感官所感知到的一切事物，其實只是我們創造出給自己的刺激。例如我們感知到一朵花的顏色其實是經由光線折射到我們的視網膜反映出來，客觀並不存在所謂的顏色。而聲音只是經由空氣的震動傳到我們的耳朵內的聽覺感知元件，客觀並不存在所謂的聲音。味覺與嗅覺只是我們人體的感知機制讓我們聞和吃到不同的味道，客觀並不存在所謂的味道。以上種種人體感知功能如果換作另一種動物，更可能有另一種因為不同物種之間感知功能的差異導致對客觀事物有不同的體會。所有我們對外界的主觀判斷都是「相」，每個人對外界事物判斷的不同也就是不同的「相」。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
Actually, the term ‘Dharma-nature’ (相) comes from Buddhist terminology.
It refers to the idea that all things that you perceive as objectively
existing are presented by the “dharma” (the nature of the human mind).
“Dharma-nature” represents the reflection and judgment of subjective
consciousness on external things caused by past experiences and formed
character traits, and has no relationship with the external things
themselves. There are many senses in our human body that allow us to
perceive different aspects of a thing through sight, hearing, touch,
taste, smell, and so on. In early Buddhism, it was believed that
everything perceived by our senses in consciousness is actually just
stimuli that we create for ourselves. For example, the color of a flower
that we perceive is actually reflected onto our retina through light
refraction, and there is no objective existence of color. Sound is only
perceived by the auditory perception component in our ears through the
vibration of air, and there is no objective existence of sound. Taste
and smell are just mechanisms in our body that allow us to smell and
taste different flavors, and there is no objective existence of taste.
If these various human senses were replaced by those of another animal,
there may be different perceptions of objective things due to
differences in sensory function between different species. All our
subjective judgments of the external world are ‘true aspect of reality’,
and everyone’s different judgments of external things are different true
aspect of reality.

最後 Finally

<p>
很多人難以想像現在很多聲稱自己修行多年的所謂大師和學歷深厚的教授所解釋的佛法基本上都是誤解，原因是因為「主觀感覺與權威」，
我們很容易主觀地賦予和陷入對人或事物的感覺，我們「覺得」那個大師和和尚很「祥和」，我們覺得那個教授「學富五車」，
所以我們單方面接受從他們的發放的訊息，沒有經過自己的思考和驗證。這也是學術型權威的一種，當我們試圖反駁他們的道理，其他「權威祟拜者」甚至比他們反應更大，用更激烈的語氣和行為去抹黑和否定異見者。其實很多對佛法的誤解都是來自於對當時語境的研究不足後產生誤解，閱讀「錯誤的佛經」，對「意識」的理解不足，也沒有經過正確的禪修。

Many people find it difficult to imagine that many so-called masters who
claim to have practiced for many years and professors with deep academic
backgrounds who explain Buddhism are basically misunderstandings,
because of ‘subjective feelings and authority’. We are easily
subjectively influenced and caught up in our feelings towards people or
things. We ‘feel’ that the master or monk is very ‘harmonious’, and we
feel that the professor is ‘well-versed’. So we unilaterally accept the
information they provide without our own thinking and verification. This
is also a type of academic authority. When we try to refute their
reasoning, other ‘authority worshippers’ may even react more strongly,
using more aggressive language and behavior to discredit and deny those
with different views. In fact, many misunderstandings about Buddhism
come from inadequate research into the context at the time, reading
“incorrect Buddhist scriptures”, insufficient understanding of
‘consciousness’, and not undergoing correct meditation.

另外，單純用「哲學」去剖析佛法也是錯誤，因為佛法並不是哲學，是一套主觀意識科學和經觀察所得的對人心所歸納出的規則。不斷重重覆覆宣傳所謂事物的「空性哲學」是一種本末倒置，令人覺得佛法只是用來說服自己接受這個世界是空的，都是因緣和合而成，並沒有體會到有什麼用途。

In addition, simply using ‘philosophy’ to analyze Buddhism is also
wrong, because Buddhism is not a philosophy, but a set of rules derived
from subjective consciousness science and observation of the human mind.
Continuously propagating the so-called ‘emptiness philosophy’ of things
is a matter of reversing the order of priority, making people feel that
Buddhism is only used to persuade oneself to accept that this world is
empty, that everything is the result of causation, and not realizing its
usefulness.
