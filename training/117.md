<p>「教條主義（Dogmatism）」原本是一種宗教概念， 指當中的教徒迷信於死板的教規， 把成文規定視作至高無上的準則， 放棄自身思考去機械死板執行相關命令和教條。這些思想造成了歷史上各種宗教迫害和人為災難。後來更涉及到社會的各個層面，包括政治、社會文化等。 所謂的教條現在可以被理解成一種人類思考方法。</p>

<p>Dogmatism was originally a religious concept, referring to the blind faith of believers in rigid religious rules and regarding written regulations as the supreme criterion, abandoning their own thinking and mechanically executing related orders and doctrines. These ideas have caused various religious persecutions and man-made disasters throughout history. Later, it has been involved in various aspects of society, including politics, social culture, and so on. The so-called dogma can now be understood as a way of human thinking.</p>

<p>西方現在主要流行的教條主要是自由平等及其派生出的各種不同價值觀， 也被稱為「西方左翼思想」。 凡是高喊或做出種種符合所謂左翼教條的口號就會得到支持反之就會受到抵制。在美國各大主流媒體不能直接稱呼黑色人種為黑人， 要稱呼為「非裔美國人」。又例如近年在美國奧斯卡電影能領受主要獎項的電影都與歌頌少數族裔、女權、殘疾、性別認同障礙者、以及性小眾等社會小眾群體等有關。甚至在美國電影必須在主角與配角之間出現少數族裔人士（主要為非白人）。甚至有西方左派學者批判各種莎士比亞劇作、西方哲學經濟學經典等都由白人所寫，是充滿偏見的， 並不能代表黑人或者少數族裔立場。</p>

<p>The main dogma currently popular in the West is the various values derived from the concepts of freedom and equality, also known as 'Western left-wing ideology.' Anyone who shouts or acts in accordance with the so-called left-wing dogma will receive support, while those who do not will be opposed. In major mainstream media in the United States, black people cannot be directly referred to as 'black,' but must be called 'African American.' For example, in recent years, the films that can receive major awards at the Oscars in the United States are all related to social minority groups that celebrate ethnic minorities, women's rights, disabilities, gender identity disorders, and sexual minorities. Even in American movies, it is necessary to have a small number of ethnic minorities between the main and supporting roles (mainly non-white people). Even Western left-wing scholars criticize various Shakespearean plays, Western philosophical and economic classics, etc., as being biased and not representing the views of black or ethnic minorities.</p>

<p>性別也是西方左派經常大造文章的地方， 之前有新聞報道指有一間餐廳拒絕一位自稱是女性但外表明顯是男性的人進入女廁而被巨額罰款。美國最高法院大法官候選人凱坦吉・傑克森（Ketanji Brown Jackson）3月22日在提名聽證會上，被共和黨籍參議員瑪莎・布萊克本（Marsha Blackburn）問及性別議題「妳能為『女人』這個詞，提供一個定義嗎？」時表示，她指出不能給出定義，因為她不是生物學家。</p>

<p>Gender is also an area where Western left-wing ideology often makes a big fuss. There was a news report before that a restaurant was fined a large amount for refusing to allow a person who claimed to be a woman but appeared to be obviously male to enter the women's bathroom. During the nomination hearing on March 22, Supreme Court Justice nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson was asked by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn about gender issues, "Can you provide a definition for the word 'woman'?" She pointed out that she could not give a definition because she is not a biologist."</p>

<p>在西方媒體中已經形成一種堅固的教條式的平均主義去維持多元文化融合的教條。這些奉行西方價值教條主義的人極力提出追求絕對的表面上的公平， 經常會放大小眾群體的生活情況， 認為我們應該要「大愛包容」， 無時無刻都要把專注力放在言行的自我審查之中。由於過度相信教條，左派人士的外在表現通常都是固執、狂熱又專制， 就像失去了思考能力的宗教信徒，<strong>但造成這些問題並不是外來的意識形態影響。表面上看是人過份的保守過份墨守成規造成，但其實從本質上反映出是思維的懶惰和停滯，甚至可以說是失去自由意志，交出自己的決定權的表現，這才是教條主義的本質</strong>。 </p>

<p>In the Western media, a strong dogmatic averageism has been formed to maintain the integration of multiculturalism. Those who adhere to Western value dogmatism vigorously advocate the pursuit of absolute superficial fairness, often neglecting the living conditions of different groups, believing that we should "tolerate with great love" and constantly focus on self-censorship of speech and behavior. Due to excessive belief in dogma, the outward appearance of left-wing individuals is usually stubborn, fanatical, and authoritarian, like religious believers who have lost their ability to think. However, these problems are not caused by external ideological influences. On the surface, it seems that people are too conservative and adhere too strictly to the rules, but in essence, it reflects laziness and stagnation of thought, and even surrendering one's decision-making power by losing free will. This is the essence of dogmatism.</p>

<p>教條主義本質上是代替思考的工具， 讓人相信跟隨及遵守教條的指引我們就會有更好的生活，不用再費力的去思考種種政治、經濟和社會等議題，一切都變得簡單，所有的問題都有答案。我們身處的現代社會是一種高度工具化的人造文明，這個人造文明本質上是和自然界相抵觸。要維持文明的運轉和不被大自然反噬，我們需要大量的維護這個社會的技術型人員，當社會擴張得越大，我們越需要更多的人力以及分工去維護這個巨大的系統。例如醫生、工程師、程序員、律師等每個職業的分工下再有更細緻的分工。在一個高度分工的社會結構和工作幾乎佔據一個人大部份時間的社會下，我們做出決定時都會習慣聽從權威人士的專業意見以及指引，再也沒有人願意思考一些宏觀的問題。每個人只需要做的事就是按部就班的完成自己的工作，不會再深度的去思考種種哲學和社會問題。<strong>簡單來說現在社會就是需要一些「教條」直接告訴你可以做什麼不可以做什麼，因為這樣做效率最高，而我們現代社會發展最需要的也是效率。而「教條主義」正正就是一種不花時間思考的實用主義，這些現代社會文化基礎之上，人類文明高速發展是教條主義快速擴張的原因</strong>。</p>

<p>In essence, dogmatism is a tool that replaces thinking and makes people believe that following and obeying dogmatic guidance will lead to a better life, without the need to think about various political, economic, and social issues. Everything becomes simple, and all problems have answers. The modern society we live in is a highly mechanized artificial civilization that is fundamentally at odds with nature. To maintain the operation of civilization and prevent nature from retaliating, we need a large number of technical personnel to maintain this huge system. As society expands, we need more manpower and division of labor to maintain this system, such as doctors, engineers, programmers, lawyers, and even more detailed divisions of labor under each profession. In a highly specialized social structure where work occupies most of a person's time, we are accustomed to listening to the professional opinions and guidance of authoritative figures when making decisions, and no one is willing to think deeply about macro issues. Everyone just needs to do their job step by step, and they won't think deeply about various philosophical and social issues. In short, modern society needs some "dogma" to directly tell you what you can and cannot do, because this is the most efficient way to do things, and what modern society needs most is efficiency. "Dogmatism" is precisely a utilitarianism that does not take time to think. On top of these modern cultural foundations, the rapid development of human civilization is the reason why dogmatism is expanding rapidly.</p>

<p>現代民主政體的道德觀念，例如公平、自由、大愛等等的起源都是為了主人可以讓奴隸們更好的工作，以互相大愛包容這些實用性的道德概念減少奴隸團體合作之間產生的磨擦， 互相友愛幫忙。到後來奴隸的自主意識「覺醒」， 創造出的價值觀和道德觀會反過來影響主人， 變成唯一的價值判斷的標準，這時候主人被整個奴隸系統反噬， 直到主人的意識消失，最後成為奴隸們的奴隸。在民主政府當中會用選票反映這種現象，就像美國現在的民主黨裡面所謂的社會精英被底層社會民眾的道德價值觀反過來控制，當社會上每個群體都抱持其狂熱和執著的是非對錯觀，不容許其他人的聲音，最後會在各群體間造成文明衝突，就像最近因俄烏戰爭而被熱烈討論的美國政治家塞繆爾·亨廷頓（Samuel Huntington）所創建的文明衝突論中所指出的文明版圖間的戰爭和衝突，最極端情況下世界會因此而毀滅。</p>

<p>The moral concepts of modern democratic political systems, such as fairness, freedom, and compassion, were originally created so that the masters could make the slaves work better. The practical moral concepts of mutual love and tolerance were used to reduce friction between slave groups and promote mutual assistance and love. Later, the slaves' self-awareness "awakened," and the values and moral concepts they created turned the tables and influenced their masters, becoming the sole standard for judging values. At this point, the masters were consumed by the entire slave system, and the masters' consciousness disappeared, eventually becoming slaves themselves. In a democratic government, this phenomenon is reflected in the ballots, such as the moral values of the lower classes of society controlling the so-called social elites in the current Democratic Party in the United States. When each group in society holds fanatical and persistent views of right and wrong, not allowing other voices, it will cause a clash of civilizations among various groups in society. This is like the war and conflict between civilizations mentioned in the Clash of Civilizations theory created by Samuel Huntington, a recent topic of heated discussion due to the Russia-Ukraine war, and the world may ultimately be destroyed as a result.</p>
