# 人格分裂病例與「鬼附」案例研究歸納及其自救治療方案 A summary of cases of Schizophrenia and "Ghost Possession", and self-help treatment plans
Date: 2023-10-28 19:50:53

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>以下內容皆來歸納於經筆者本人親自接觸，並經由雙方同意自願提供過去病例和接受本人的建議後進行自我治療的人格分裂症病患和聲稱被「鬼附」者。由於這些人格分裂症患者病患和被「鬼附」者所有紀錄之間皆有高度相似性， 所以在此作出詳細歸納並在最後提供一些可能的自救治療方案。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following content is all summarized from the author’s personal contact, and with the mutual agreement of the parties, voluntarily provided past cases and accepted the author’s advice for self-treatment of schizophrenia patients and those who claim to be possessed by ghosts. Because there is a high degree of similarity between all the records of these schizophrenia patients and those who claim to be ‘possessed by ghosts’, a detailed summary is made here and some possible self-help treatment plans are provided at the end.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">人格分裂的條件和過程 <br>The conditions and process of "personality splitting (schizophrenia)"</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在各種人格分裂病例中明確顯示出人格分裂從來並不是一蹴而就，大多數人都在童年或青少年時期，由於理性（顯意識）未完全發展對感性（潛意識）制衡的能力下突然受到重大情緒衝擊如家暴、欺凌等等，有迫切需要從現實逃避當下的暴力而不自覺地創造人格，最後導致強大想像力在缺乏理性制衡下的失控而造成人格分裂。當然這並不代表在成年時期不會發生人格分裂，因為<strong>人格分裂問題的核心是強大感性能力與想像力所創造出來的「獨立人格」。</strong>這些次人格最後不但有自己的記憶（甚至在有些病例出現不同人格之間的記憶共享），甚至擁有自己的性格，也不受肉體所規限地同時分裂出現不同性別、年齡、知識及國籍等等人格，而在童年出現的第一個小孩人格就是所有人格的「種子人格」，也是最有「力量」的人格， 有些研究認為其他次人格都是分裂自這個「種子人格」。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is clearly shown in various cases of Schizophrenia that Schizophrenia is never achieved overnight. Most people, during their childhood or adolescence, due to the lack of rational (conscious) ability to balance the sensibility (subconscious), suddenly suffer from a major emotional shock such as domestic violence, bullying, etc., and have an urgent need to escape from the reality of violence and unconsciously create personalities, which eventually leads to the loss of control of the powerful imagination without rational balance and causes Schizophrenia. Of course, this does not mean that Schizophrenia will not occur in adulthood, <strong>because the core problem of Schizophrenia (personality splitting) is the "independent personality" created by the powerful sensibility and imagination. </strong>These secondary personalities not only have their own memories (and even share memories between different personalities in some cases), but also have their own personalities, and are not limited by the body to split into different genders, ages, knowledge, and even nationalities, etc. The first child personality that appeared in childhood is the "seed personality" of all personalities, and also the most "powerful" personality. Some studies believe that other secondary personalities are split from this "seed personality".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在所有人格分裂病例中，病患都指出他們對他們所創造的次人格已經建立某種難以割捨的感情，甚至失去醫治人格分裂的動機和意義。其原因是在他們的成長過程中這些次人格就是陪伴他們成長的最親密的朋友，面對和經歷生活痛苦和困難陪伴在側的「戰友」。而在主人格與次人格的相處當中，次人格從不斷產生「念頭」、「內在對話」和情緒不斷刺激主人格讓主人格更加依賴次人格的存在，讓主人格聚焦在與次人格的親密關係。 在這段時間內，主人格不斷透過「內在對話」來「餵養」次人格讓其逐漸成長壯大甚至開始讓主人格失去對身體的控制權而出現記憶模糊，以及四肢失控等情況。主人格甚至失去生活某部份或全部時間的記憶，到這階段就代表次人格已經完全掌控身體，甚至偽裝成主人格地正常生活。很多人不切實際地認為可以與次人格「共存」，但次人格在足夠成熟後已經開胎擁有「自我意識」，開始不甘心被困在「他人」的身體裡，這種情況對他們來說就猶如在監獄裡看著直播他人生活的電視節目，所以次人格會用盡一切手段迫切地搶奪主人格的身體控制權嘗試「逃獄」。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In all cases of personality splitting, patients indicate that they have established some kind of inseparable emotion for the secondary personalities they created, and even lose the motivation and meaning of treating personality splitting. The reason is that these secondary personalities are the most intimate friends who accompany them in their growth process, and the "comrades" who accompany them in the face of and experience life's pain and difficulties. And in the interaction between the main personality and the secondary personality, the secondary personality constantly stimulates the main personality with "thoughts", "inner dialogue" and emotions, making the main personality more dependent on the existence of the secondary personality, and making the main personality focus on the intimate relationship with the secondary personality. During this period of time, the main personality constantly "feeds" the secondary personality through "inner dialogue" to make it gradually grow stronger and even begin to make the main personality lose control of the body and appear blurred memory, and limb loss of control. The main personality even loses part or all of the time memory of life, which means that the secondary personality has completely controlled the body, and even pretends to live normally as the main personality. Many people unrealistically think that they can "coexist" with secondary personalities, but secondary personalities have "self-awareness" after they are mature enough, and begin to be unwilling to be trapped in someone else's body. This situation is like watching a live TV show of someone else's life in prison for them, so secondary personalities will do everything possible to desperately seize control of the main personality's body and try to "escape".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>這些被分裂出來的次人格與主人格有本質上的分別，所有被創造出來的次人格都是想像力（右腦）的產物，有些人格分裂症患者甚至感到左半身和左腦被大量神經訊號衝擊的感覺，有關於「理性（左腦）」的掌控能力越來越弱，所以必然向著「絕對感性（動物性）」發展。所以在人格分裂後期，除了個人情緒慾望被不斷放大到極致，甚至在各種案例中都發現病患都不約而同有自殘、進食生肉或拒絕進食、把玩血和排洩物、表現出他人的強大攻擊性甚至完全「動物（獸）化」。所以在歷史不同時期的宗教觀點當中，人格分裂都被大多數宗教信徒認為是一種「鬼附現象」。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These split-out secondary personalities are fundamentally different from the main personality. All created secondary personalities are products of imagination (right brain). Some patients with personality splitting even feel that their left half-body and left brain are hit by a large amount of nerve signals, and their ability to control "rationality (left brain)" becomes weaker and weaker, so they inevitably develop towards "absolute sensibility (animality)". Therefore, in the late stage of personality splitting, in addition to personal emotions and desires being constantly magnified to the extreme, even self-harm, eating raw meat or refusing to eat, playing with blood and excrement, showing strong aggressiveness towards others or even completely "animalizing (beastizing)" are found in various cases. Therefore, in different historical periods of religious views, personality splitting was regarded as a kind of "ghost possession phenomenon" by most religious believers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">「鬼附」的條件和過程 <br>The conditions and process of "Ghost Possession"</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>很多宗教也有相應的驅魔專業人士為受害者驅魔，如道士、神父、薩滿、法師等等。在基督教派系統中的附體現象中，我們在很多不同媒體甚至電影當中看到很多人類被「惡魔」附體的例子，「惡魔」的英語Demon來自於希臘文的δαίμων（Daemon），正確解釋為「來自自然的靈」，而且有正邪之分。 Devil來自於希臘文的Διάβολος（Diabolus），有中傷他人者或敵人等負面含意。 在基督教派中有大半的惡魔都是天使墮天下來的說法，在梵帝崗天主教更有一門驅魔課程教授神父驅魔儀式與魔鬼學。而在現代道教與佛教當中也能尋找到相當多的驅魔文化傳承以及媒體紀錄驅魔行為。綜合各宗教及媒體有關記載被附體的特徵亦大致相同，當中大部份亦和我們所認知的精神疾病非常相似。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many religions also have corresponding exorcism professionals to exorcise the victims, such as Taoist priests, priests, shamans, magicians, and so on. In the phenomenon of possession in the Christian sect system, we see many examples of humans being possessed by "demons" in many different media and even movies. The English word "demon" comes from the Greek word δαίμων, which means "spirit from nature", and has both positive and negative meanings. Devil comes from the Greek word Διάβολος (Diabolus), which has negative meanings such as slanderer or enemy. In most of the Christian sects, there is a saying that most of the demons are angels who fell from heaven. In the Vatican Catholic Church, there is even a course on exorcism that teaches priests the exorcism ritual and demonology. And in modern Taoism and Buddhism, there are also many exorcism cultural inheritances and media records of exorcism behaviors. The characteristics of being possessed by various religions and media are also roughly the same, most of which are very similar to the mental illnesses we know.</p>

<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>在被附體初期會感受到情緒與慾望的增強，例如脾氣暴燥、性慾食慾等慾望會越來越大。<br>In the early stages of possession, the victim may experience an increase in emotions and desires, such as a short temper, increased sexual or food cravings, etc.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>傳說有些被附體者周圍的動物或會有異常現象，如昆蟲、狗、鳥、烏鴉等動物聚集或者異常行為。甚至有相關記載為家中的物品會在明顯非外力作用下作出移動或被破壞的現象。家中的雞蛋或者食物變壞等等。<br>It is said that some people who are possessed by spirits may have abnormal phenomena around the animals near them, such as insects, dogs, birds, crows and other animals gathering or behaving strangely. There are even related records of household items moving or being destroyed without obvious external force. Eggs or food in the house may go bad and so on.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>在被附體中期，被附體者會進一步感受到精神情緒失控，甚至出現不能自控的表情和行為。又或會出現厭食、抑鬱、或會聽到或見到一些異象（類似思覺失調）。<br>In the middle stages of possession, the victim may experience a further loss of mental control, displaying uncontrollable expressions and behavior. They may also experience anorexia, depression, or hallucinations (similar to schizophrenia).<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>被附體者的身體或會有一些醫學不明原因的異常，如潰爛、吐血、口吐白沬。或會出現一些異常行為，例如自殘、突然說出一些從未學過的異國語文或寫出一些異國文字、吃生肉或排洩物等「獸性」行為等等甚至逐漸發展中一個或多個異常人格。這些人格在文獻紀錄當中甚至有一些異常能力，如反物理現象、預知、讀心、準確說出他人的秘密、擁有某死者的記憶等等。<br>The body of the possessed person may have some medically unexplained abnormalities, such as ulcers, vomiting blood, or spitting white foam. Or they may exhibit some abnormal behaviors, such as self-harm, suddenly speaking or writing foreign languages that they have never learned, eating raw meat or excrement, and other 'animalistic' behaviors. They may even develop one or more abnormal personalities. These personalities have some abnormal abilities in the literature records, such as anti-physical phenomena, precognition, mind reading, accurately revealing the secrets of others, having the memories of a deceased person, and so on.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>被附體後期可能會因厭食或進食不當食物而導致嚴重營養不良後瀕死，「獸性」行為加劇導致的發展出完整的動物性行為，這種狀態可能會持續幾天或到幾年。當主意識被潛意識或外來意識完全掩蓋後甚至加劇自殘或者自殺行為。<br>In the later stages of possession, the victim may suffer from severe malnutrition due to anorexia or improper eating habits, leading to near-death experiences. The “bestial” behavior may intensify, resulting in complete animalistic behavior that can last for days or years. When the primary consciousness is completely suppressed by the subconscious or external consciousness, the victim may even intensify self-harm or suicide behavior.</li>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>綜合以上現象，我們可以進一步歸納鬼附現象的特徵：<br>Based on the above phenomena, we can further summarize the characteristics of spirit possession</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>附體現象是有程度之分<br>Possession phenomena vary in degree.<br></li>

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>異常記憶與能力<br>Abnormal memory and abilities.<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>附體的次人格為「絕對感性」或「獸性」，將存在於人心中的不論正負面情緒以及慾望進一步放大，並縮細事主的理性監護能力。最後主意識被內在或外來意識「佔領」或獨立於理性完全分裂出一種「絕對感性（獸性）」的人格<br>The secondary personality of the possessed person is "absolute sensibility" or "animality", which magnifies the positive and negative emotions and desires that exist in the human heart, and reduces the rational guardianship ability of the subject. Finally, the main consciousness is "occupied" or completely separated from rationality by an internal or external consciousness, forming a personality of "absolute sensibility (animality)".<br></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>周圍環境的異常或超自然現象<br>Abnormal or supernatural phenomena in the surrounding environment.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>經過筆者對有關鬼附的一系列研究，在靈擾事件初期「鬼」雖然不能馬上對受害人有直接影響， 例如接近受害人所在的環境、附體等等，但它們會先透過不斷對受害者作出間接騷擾，以削弱受害者的精神狀態。這時候受害者的情緒會因缺乏休息和開始疑神疑鬼後變得不穩定，然後「鬼」才可以對受害者作出進一步的行動。很多人會被恐懼情緒佔據而失去思考能力。儘管有所謂超自然現象出現也不代表能力沒有限制，如果「鬼」的能力高強到可以為所欲為，人類估計早就被滅絕。歸納種種鬼附個案後，似乎「鬼魂」需要人類的負面情緒累積到某種程度才能進一步對事主作出進一步的行動；而「鬼」的力量來源似乎也是內自於情緒，它們的行為模式也與人格分裂病患高度相似。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a series of research on ghost possession by the author, in the early stage of spiritual disturbance events, although "ghosts" cannot have direct effects on the victims immediately, such as approaching the environment where the victims are or possessing them, they will first make indirect harassment to the victims continuously to weaken their mental state. At this time, the victim's emotions will become unstable due to lack of rest and start to doubt everything. Then "ghosts" can take further actions against the victims. Many people will be occupied by fear and lose their ability to think. Although there are so-called supernatural phenomena, it does not mean that they have no limitations. If the "ghosts" are powerful enough to do whatever they want, humans would probably have been extinct. After summarizing various cases of ghost possession, it seems that "ghosts" need human negative emotions to accumulate to a certain level before they can take further actions against the subject; and the source of "ghosts" power seems to be within emotions, their behavior patterns are also highly similar to those of patients with Schizophrenia.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">人格分裂與鬼附可能的自救治療方案 <br>The possible self-help treatment plans of Schizophrenia and "Ghost Possession" </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>根據筆者所接觸的人格分裂症病患和聲稱被「鬼附」者的使用經驗，以下方法都被他們認為是可行的自救治療方案，並在部份人格分裂患者和被「鬼附」者當中有相當明顯的療效。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the experience of patients with schizophrenia and people who claim to be "possessed by ghosts" that I have contacted, the following methods are considered feasible self-help treatment options by them, and have obvious therapeutic effects among some patients with schizophrenia and those who are "possessed by ghosts".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">一：透過觀察自己的意識來建立對次人格正確的認知和態度<br>1: Establish a correct understanding and attitude towards secondary personalities by observing one's own consciousness.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>勇敢地觀察腦內念頭的聲音和與次人格當中的對答，尋找次人格聲音發起的地方（念頭）產生的地方及其消失的地方，並透過這些觀察來建立對其虛假存在的認知。一開始次人格會以朋友、甚至已去世的親人等等親密關係的身份來與人格分裂者相處，但大多數的次人格最後都會得到足夠控制權後就會企圖搶奪主人格的控制權，所以人格分裂患者在此期間可以透過觀察次人格的行為判斷他們的動機。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bravely observe the voices and dialogues of the secondary personalities in your mind, and find out where they originate, where they disappear, and establish a cognition of their false existence through these observations. In the beginning, the secondary personalities will interact with the personality splitting patients as friends, or even as deceased relatives and other intimate relationships, but most of the secondary personalities will eventually gain enough control and try to seize the control of the main personality. Therefore, during this period, personality splitting patients can judge their motives by observing their behaviors</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>另外，有些人格分裂病患者或被鬼附者會相信腦中自己所創造的次人格是某種強大的神靈和惡魔，這些次人格會顯示自己的能力，包括對患者的控制能力和對患者的「全知」能力。當然這種「全知」能力只是單純地知道患者腦內的訊息，並不會「知道」患者認知外的記憶和事情。勇敢地懷疑和驗證這些他們本質和其表現出的能力來建立次人格是虛假的認知是非常重要。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, some personality splitting patients or those who are possessed by ghosts will believe that the secondary personalities they created in their minds are some powerful gods and demons. These secondary personalities will show their abilities, including their control ability and their "omniscience" ability over the patients. Of course, this "omniscience" ability is simply knowing the information in the patient's mind, and does not "know" the memories and things outside the patient's cognition. It is very important to bravely doubt and verify their essence and their abilities to establish a cognition that the secondary personalities are false.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">二：讓顯意識重新掌握控制權，訓練理性思維和忽略周遭環境和大腦中多餘的訊息<br>2: Let the conscious mind regain control, train rational thinking and ignore the redundant information in the environment and the brain.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>人格分裂病患者或被鬼附者的主人格在強大的次人格的衝擊下如同一根蠟燭在狂風暴雨當中保持自己的火種一樣困難。困難並不是在於次人格的力量有多大，而是自己因為恐懼、愛慾、不捨等等對次人格的慾望情緒而主動交出自己的控制權給次人格。必須學會面對和忽略情緒和慾望的影響才能逐漸掌握自己的控制權，勇敢地在狂風暴雨之下保存自己的「火種」。例如努力讓自己專心在某種運動和行為如呼吸、跑步、騎腳踏車等等，一旦有任何「聲音」或者念頭在腦中響起尋求對話就立即回到當下所專心的事物當中， 即時並迅速地拒絕一切次人格所要求的「對答（餵養）」， 知道但不理會任何身體或大腦的任何異常反應（無論是不能控制的手腳和面容等等），完全專注在當下，久而久之內在對話會越來越少，甚至完全消失。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The main personality of personality splitting patients or those who are possessed by ghosts is as difficult as a candle in a storm to maintain its own flame under the impact of the powerful secondary personalities. The difficulty is not how powerful the secondary personalities are, but that they voluntarily give up their control to the secondary personalities because of fear, love, attachment and other emotional desires for the secondary personalities. They must learn to face and ignore the influence of emotions and desires in order to gradually master their own control, and bravely preserve their own "flame" in the storm. For example, try to focus on some kind of exercise or behavior such as breathing, running, cycling, etc., and once any "voice" or thought sounds in your mind seeking dialogue, immediately return to what you are focusing on at the moment, and instantly and quickly refuse all "dialogues (feeding)" requested by the secondary personalities. Know but ignore any abnormal reactions of your body or brain (whether it is uncontrollable hands, feet, face, etc.), focus completely on the present. Over time, the inner dialogue will become less and less, or even disappear completely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>另外，可以在平日進行大量理性思維訓練，進行一切可以訓練歸納、演譯、抽象、窮舉、批判、比喻、分割等等一系列思考工具能力的活動，如數學、哲學、棋類活動、益智遊戲等等。學會懷疑某種想法和概念的合理性，讓自己的思考不再被情緒慾望等等所打擾。當自己真正完全掌握身體所有的控制後一切問題迎刃而解。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, you can do a lot of rational thinking training in your daily life, and do all kinds of activities that can train your thinking tools such as induction, deduction, abstraction, exhaustion, criticism, analogy, segmentation, etc., such as mathematics, philosophy , chess activities, puzzle games, etc. Learn to doubt the rationality of some ideas and concepts, and let your thinking no longer be disturbed by emotions and desires. When you truly fully master all control of your body, all problems will be solved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">三：適當的營養補充和行為來增加理性和顯意識訓練效率<br>3: Appropriate nutritional supplements and behaviours to increase the efficiency of rational and conscious training.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>「血清素」是平伏身體內猛獸的關鍵，一切可以生產血清素的食物和行為都能增加自己重新掌握身體控制權的勝算。要產生血清素需要多攝取色胺酸和維他命B和D 的食物，如牛奶、香蕉、魚肉、雞蛋、綠茶等等，以及多曬太陽，和專心在某種運動和行為如呼吸、跑步、騎腳踏車、跳繩等等。可以使用營養補充品，但要注意不要過量地補充和不要與精神病藥物配合使用，有需要可以自行咨詢醫生或藥物專家。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Serotonin" is the key to subdue the beast in the body, and all foods and behaviors that can produce serotonin can increase the chance of regaining control of the body. To produce serotonin, you need to consume more foods with tryptophan and vitamins B and D, such as milk, bananas, fish, eggs, green tea, etc., as well as get more sun exposure, and focus on some kind of exercise or behavior such as breathing, running, cycling, skipping rope, etc. You can use nutritional supplements, but be careful not to overdose and do not use them with psychiatric drugs. You can consult a doctor or drug expert if you need to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>另外，薑黃也是被認為是一種提升腦部能力的食品，在古印度吠陀時期也常常被當作日常補充和醫療使用。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, turmeric is also considered a food that enhances brain power and was often used as a daily supplement and for medical use in ancient Vedic times in India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">四：家人和朋友等等身邊人的特殊訓練<br>4: Special training for family and friends and other people around.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>單純地滿足人格分裂病患者或被鬼附者的次人格提出的需求並不是一個可行的方案，這只可能會讓徵狀看起來暫時舒緩，但這只會讓次人格的控制權增加並讓之後的情況更加惡化。例如次人格要求大量進食某肉類，在當下的需求被滿足下會在未來某時刻再次提出更大量進食或其他的特殊要求。在不斷滿足其需求的過程中慾望會大量增加，最後只會加速次人格的動物性覆蓋在主人格之上，最後主人格失去所有控制權後讓情況完全徹底失控。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply satisfying the needs of the secondary personalities of personality splitting patients or those who are possessed by ghosts is not a feasible solution. This may only make the symptoms seem temporarily relieved, but it will only increase the control of the secondary personalities and make the situation worse later. For example, if the secondary personality requests a large amount of meat consumption, it will make another larger request or other special requests at some future time after the current demand is met. In the process of constantly satisfying their needs, desires will increase greatly, and finally accelerate the animal nature of the secondary personality to cover the main personality. After the main personality loses all control, the situation will be completely out of control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>身邊的朋友和家人必須要先忽略患者體內次人格的說話，相信次人格只是主人格想像出來的，本質並不是主人格，只是透過主人格的身體說話。讓自己的心情平靜後，使用柔和的音樂配合，專注地對患者的頭部（如頭皮、耳垂、面頰）或身體不同部位的按摩，在人格分裂病患者或被鬼附者耳旁輕聲細語及燃點香或香薰等等方式，讓次人格感受身體舒服的感覺來平伏次人格的動物性，這會對主人格的反抗有非常大的幫助。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Friends and family around must first ignore what the secondary personalities in the patient's body say, believe that the secondary personalities are just imagined by the main personality, and are not essentially the main personality, but just speak through the main personality's body. After calming down your mood, use soft music to accompany you, focus on massaging different parts of the patient's head (such as scalp, earlobe, cheek) or body. Use methods such as whispering in the ear of personality splitting patients or those who are possessed by ghosts and lighting incense or aromatherapy to make the secondary personality feel comfortable in the body and subdue its animal nature. This will be very helpful for the main personality's resistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>註: 可以參考坊間ASMR、育兒或動物園馴獸方法<br>Note: You can refer to ASMR, parenting or zoo animal training methods in the market.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">五：靜觀到入睡和減少睡眠時間至每天六至七小時<br>5: Meditate until you fall asleep and reduce sleep time to six to seven hours per day.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>人格患者之間都不謀而合地出現一些渴睡的特徵，隨著睡眠時間越長，其次人格們出現時間和影響也會大大提升。這是因為其他次人格會非常希望主人格常常處於睡眠狀態，在長時間地進入睡眠狀態後主人格會因為對現實的覺知能力降低，而讓次人格們的意識力量增強。所以患者也同時需要減少一些睡眠時間，除了不要睡午覺之餘，在晚上睡覺時間外刻意克服睡意也是一種顯著地提升對次人格的意識力的方法。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personality disorder patients all coincidentally show some characteristics of sleepiness. As the sleep time gets longer, the appearance time and influence of the sub-personalities will greatly increase. This is because other sub-personalities very much hope that the main personality is often in a state of sleep. After a long time of entering a sleep state, the main personality will reduce its awareness of reality, thereby enhancing the consciousness power of the sub-personalities. Therefore, patients also need to reduce some sleep time. In addition to not taking a nap, deliberately overcoming sleepiness outside the sleeping time at night is also a significant method to enhance the consciousness power of the sub-personalities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>另外用一些靜觀方法，如觀呼吸、數呼吸、內觀身體的感受、專心聆聽重覆性強的白噪音音樂、努力放鬆身體和清空大腦等等，最後在靜觀過程中達至自然入睡。這不但可以提昇睡眠質素，減少因為夢境的精神消耗而失去顯意識對次人格的覺知力，也會讓人有起床後非常舒服清爽， 讓專注力提高。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, use some mindfulness methods, such as observing breathing, counting breaths, introspecting the body’s feelings, focusing on listening to repetitive strong white noise music, striving to relax the body and empty the brain, etc., and finally reach natural sleep in the process of mindfulness. This can not only improve sleep quality, reduce the loss of conscious awareness of sub-personalities due to the mental consumption of dreams, but also make people feel very comfortable and refreshed after waking up, and improve concentration.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">六：透過不斷集中地念頌（或默念）一些短句來提升顯意識集中力 <br>6: Improve the concentration of consciousness by continuously focusing on reciting (or silently reciting) some short sentences.</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>世界各地很多宗教都相信透過不斷念頌後或默念一些短句可以排除所有雜念，並作為其主要修行方式。所以這裡不妨嘗試不斷念頌一些「意義不明的短句」來讓自己集中力提升。如果有佛教宗教信仰或一時沒有什麼想法，也可以借助一些佛教的「梵文心咒」來使用， 但不需要理解所念的短句的實際意思為何。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Many religions around the world believe that by continuously reciting or silently reciting some short sentences, all distractions can be eliminated, and it serves as their main practice. So here, you might want to try continuously reciting some "meaningless short sentences" to improve your concentration. If you have Buddhist religious beliefs or no ideas for a while, you can also use some Buddhist "Sanskrit mantras", but you don’t need to understand the actual meaning of the short sentences you recite.</p>

<p><strong>念心經、大悲咒等等長篇大論的經文是完全沒有效果的</strong>。而念唱是與呼吸相依，所有發音都必定為在「呼」的情況下被頌唱，所以短句不能多於或少於一個呼的時間，大概六至十二音節為最佳。<strong>另外，念心經、大悲咒等等長篇大論的經文是完全沒有效果的</strong>。另外如果念出的句子對特定神靈帶有某種信仰的祈禱，會較容易看見該宗教神靈的幻象。</p>

<p>Reciting sutras, the Great Compassion Mantra, and other lengthy scriptures have no effect at all. And chanting is dependent on breathing, all pronunciations must be chanted in the "1exhale" situation, so the short sentence cannot be more or less than one exhale time, about six to twelve syllables is the best. Also, reciting sutras, the Great Compassion Mantra, and other lengthy scriptures have no effect at all. In addition, if the sentence you recite carries a certain prayer of faith to a specific deity, it will be easier to see the illusion of the deity of that religion.</p>
