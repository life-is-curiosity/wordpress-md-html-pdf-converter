<p>假設一個情境，你被人用棍棒打到失去所有記憶，你可能會感到開心或無感覺，但至少不會感到痛苦或傷心。如果你同意這個觀點，那麼問題就出在你的記憶上。因為你的記憶會影響你現在的情緒，但不會對你現在的物理狀態產生任何影響。</p>

<p>Imagine a scenario where you are hit by a stick and lose all your memories. You might feel happy or indifferent, but at least you won’t feel pain or sadness. If you agree with this view, then the problem lies in your memory. Because your memories can affect your current emotions, but they won’t have any physical impact on you now.</p>

<p>如果想要得到比較深刻的生活體驗，風險管理就不能太緊，不能保護得自己太好，但一旦受傷後的痛苦也會比較深刻。如果想要比較安全的生活，風險管理不能太鬆，不能沒在保護好自己情況下就投入每一件事物和每一段關係，這雖然受傷帶來的痛苦比較少，但生活體驗因為保護措施也會因此而相對減少。</p>

<p>If you want to have a deeper life experience, risk management cannot be too tight, you cannot protect yourself too well, but the pain after being injured will be more profound. If you want a safer life, risk management cannot be too loose, you cannot invest in every thing and every relationship without protecting yourself well, although the pain caused by the injury is less, the life experience will also be relatively reduced due to protective measures.</p>

<p>人有一種在潛意識層面的自我保護機制。因為潛意識會在人不自覺下根據人的生活經驗和創傷去自動調整生活風險管理計劃。如果受過一次大的創傷，或者連續的創傷，你的風險管理就會變得非常的保守。這些創傷也是和當初沒有用理性保護好自己的潛意識有關， 讓自己在完全沒有理性制約下完全投入一段關係和一件事物，最後感受到的痛苦也非常深刻最後再加深自我保護機制。這需要與過去的創傷共存才能把這種機制解除。</p>

<p>People have a kind of self-protection mechanism at the subconscious level. Because the subconscious will unconsciously and automatically adjust the life risk management plan according to a person’s life experience and trauma, if you have suffered a major trauma or continuous trauma, your risk management will become very conservative. These traumas are also related to the subconscious that did not rationally protect oneself at the beginning, allowing oneself to fully invest in a relationship and a thing without any rational constraints, and the pain felt in the end is also very deep and deeply adds more of a self-protection mechanism. This requires coexistence with past traumas to lift this mechanism.</p>

<p>所以，與痛苦共存的意思是，你需要對付的事物實際上是過去與現在的連結。只要你斷開這個連結，即使你擁有這些記憶，你也不會感到痛苦難受。方法就是，感受過去那些不好的記憶，在狂風暴雨中保持自己不被吹走，久而久之就不會困擾你。</p>

<p>So, the meaning of coexisting with pain is that what you need to deal with is actually the connection between the past and the present. As long as you break this connection, even if you have these memories, you won’t feel pain or unhappiness. The method is to feel those bad memories from the past, stay in the storm without being blown away, and it won’t bother you over time.</p>

<p>實際情況可能是，你在無遮無掩的野外，狂風暴雨中，但你靜坐在某個地方，任何風吹雨打，都控制住自己如山般不動。你可能會覺得冷、痛、累等等，但都不要讓這些情緒和感受影響你。當情緒來的時候，你就這樣做就可以了。不必說一定要像冥想或靜觀那樣做，你可以把它當作一種情緒來臨時的應對方案。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The actual situation might be that you are in the wild with no shelter, in the storm, but you sit quietly somewhere, any wind and rain, control yourself like a mountain. You may feel cold, pain, tired, etc., but don’t let these emotions and feelings affect you. When the emotion comes, just do it. You don’t have to say that you have to do it like meditation or mindfulness, you can treat it as a coping plan when emotions come.</p>

<p>最後，讓你痛苦的是你的記憶還是其他人？這是一個需要思考的問題。</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, is it your memory or other people that make you suffer? This is a question that needs to be thought about.</p>
