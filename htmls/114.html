The Responsibilities of Coding</h1>

As I know many developers have been fixing the bugs which made by other
guys. The bugs always come out with the tight deadline, bad time
management, think before you code, bad coding style…etc. Anyway, we have
been making bugs at any time for any reason. And a bug will potentially
cost you more than a million dollar in the financial industry. Here is
talking about

have we always been making Bugs on the system?</a>

I think we all agree the quality of code is linking with our dignity and
personality. If someone doesn’t even want to see his code again and feel
nasty that means he thinks that he wrote a bunch of garbage as well,
Certified Dead!. After this guy is gone, you might have to pick up the
dirty work with high pressure, and no one cares about the code but the
result, it will be worse in a fast-piece environment. Actually, you
didn’t do anything wrong but you need to fix someone’s bug as soon as
possible. Generally you feel frustrated and confused about the code and
career and finally, you may want to quit from your job one day as well.
This is how the bug with bad coding to lose the most valuable programmer
in the company.

In ninety-nine percent of the time, you need to fix someone’s bug
without any documents and diagrams and even a single line of comment.
Every programmer has their coding style and skills and the code is
representing how do a programmer work for the business with his
understanding. That means you have to understand the whole business
logic and trace the root cause of the bug by the code with line by line.
This is not about the ability, due to understanding the code which wrote
by someone is not that easy as you thought. Especially many programmers
don’t know what have they done after they worked for more than 12 hours
non-stop.

Please be responsible for your code and don’t let other people fix your
bugs anymore. I usually make a bunch of diagrams to show how my logic
works with the code. UML is quite useful with Enterprise Architect /
DrawIO. The comments among your code are very important for helping
someone to know your story whatever you wrote many shit code. Separate
the responsibilities of your code, don’t try to finish all the things
within a function. From the management perspective, please be polite to
explain the bugs is not anyone’s fault but there is no way out at this
moment so that to reduce the bad emotion of the code in the future.
